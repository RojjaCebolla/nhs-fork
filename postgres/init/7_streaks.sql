-- Following trigger function is bound to INSERT/DELETE on map_games_streaks
-- table that maps rows between "games" and "streaks" (N:1). It does two
-- things: 1) automatically increments/decrements streaks.num_games when
-- mapping is added/removed to/from map_games_streaks. 2) If
-- streaks.num_games reaches 0 on deleting; the streak itself is removed.
-- The latter functionality is here to make deleting games straightforward
-- but note that full consistency is still not guaranteed; if you delete
-- games from "games" table, you must delete all games with the same
-- logfiles_i to ensure integrity.
